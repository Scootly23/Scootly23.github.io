				<h3>My background</h3>
				<p> I was born and raised in White Bear Lake, MN; a smaller suburb of St. Paul and I went on to complete my degree in computer science at North Dakota State University -Go Bison! I currently 
					work full time as a software developer here in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area (For more information on my software development career please visit my professional website <a href="#">here</a>). 
					I picked up photography as a hobby in high school and while I was going to college I started doing it professionally, ever since then I realized I loved it and its something 
					I wanted to continue doing professionally even after I graduated college. In addition to that you can usually find me out exploring the outdoors, playing my saxophone, or nerding out over a new video game.</p>

				<h3>What I do</h3>
				<p>I offer a wide range of services as a professional photographer. I'm definately not limited to the services listed below and I'm always excited to try new things so please feel free to contact me about any of you photography needs!</p>
				<div class="services left">
					<h4>Weddings</h4>
					<p>This is by far one of the more popular services I offer as a professional photographer. I'm typically there the entire day from when the bride puts in her first bobby pin all the way until the last few people filter out of the reception, capturing every moment of your big day along the way.<img src="images/weddings.jpg" style="width:100%"/>
